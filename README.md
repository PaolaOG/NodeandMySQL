# NodeandMySQL

### This activity is about creating an Amazon-like storefront with the MySQL skills you learned this unit. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory.

##### Like said before this app simulates an Amazon - like storefront with a CLI (command line interface).
###### When you run the app, the first thing that will be displayed is " What's the id nuumber yo want to buy?", then it will continue to display a chart (you can see it in more detail in the screenshots folder) and then it willl ask you 2 more questions; After this cuestions are answered then it will dispaly what i like to call a "recipt" this wil tell how much you paid for the amount of products you want to buy and then the database sill continue to update itself.

#### Feel free to check out the code and how it looks on git bash in the screen shots folder.

### Also make sure to check out my portafolio, where i have more projects.
